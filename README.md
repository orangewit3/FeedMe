# FeedMe
Alexa skills project
Our Alexa skills application is called Feed Me, a skill that helps users pinpoint and learn about their interests in certain fields based on how they react to articles in their field. 

When prompted by the user, feed me reads a summarized version of an article up to one time each day. The user then reacts to the article by pointing out specific keywords they found interesting or thought-provoking within the article. Our application then utilizes a genetic algorithm to find an article that is to be read to the user the next day that focuses on what they liked about the previous article. Feed Me is unique in its ability to pinpoint a userâ€™s interest in a smarter way and intuitive way while at the same time teaching them more and more about their selected interest.
